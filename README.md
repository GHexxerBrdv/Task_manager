📝 Explanation

This project is like building your own to-do list app in the terminal. The idea is simple but powerful — you’ll combine Rust fundamentals (ownership, lifetimes, error handling) with real-world utilities (command-line parsing, file storage, and structured data handling).

It’s a great first project because:

It’s practical (you’ll actually use it).

It forces you to work with I/O, serialization, structs & enums, and error handling.

It scales nicely — you can start with a super basic version and grow it into something almost production-ready.

🎯 Core Features (MVP – Minimum Viable Product)

Add Task – Add a task with a description.

List Tasks – Show all tasks.

Mark Task as Done – Mark a task as completed.

Delete Task – Remove a task by ID.

Persistence – Save/load tasks from a file (JSON).

🚀 Extended Features (Level 2 – More Practical)

Categories – Each task belongs to a category (Work, Personal, Study).

Priorities – Low, Medium, High priority.

Due Dates – Store deadlines using chrono crate.

Search/Filter – Filter by category, priority, or completed status.

Colored Output – Use colored crate to display high-priority tasks in red, completed ones in green.

🔥 Advanced Features (Level 3 – Pushing Rust Concepts)

SQLite Storage – Replace JSON with a database (rusqlite crate).

Concurrency – Support multiple commands running in parallel safely.

Custom Command Syntax – Like task add "Buy milk" --priority high --due tomorrow.

Export/Import – Export tasks to CSV/Markdown.

Plugin System – Let users define macros (like task work → auto-filters "Work" tasks).

🦀 Rust Concepts You’ll Practice

Ownership & Borrowing – Storing tasks in a Vec<Task> or HashMap<u32, Task>.

Structs & Enums – Define Task, Priority, Category.

Traits – Implement Display for pretty-printing tasks.

Error Handling – Use Result and thiserror or custom enums.

Serialization – With serde + serde_json.

Crates – clap (CLI parsing), chrono (dates), colored (terminal colors).

🏗️ Functional Flow Example

$ task add "Finish Rust project" --priority high --category Work --due 2025-09-15
Task added ✅

$ task list
[1] Finish Rust project | Priority: High | Category: Work | Due: 2025-09-15 | Status: Pending

$ task done 1
Task #1 marked as completed 🎉

$ task list
[1] Finish Rust project | Priority: High | Category: Work | Due: 2025-09-15 | Status: ✅ Done
